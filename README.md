##Who doesn't like delicious pizza?
README

import project

Purpose:
This pizzeria site is a performance nightmare. Record a timeline trace and watch the Forced Synchronous Layout warnings pop up. Can you make this site run at 60fps?

Installation:
Install project through GitHub.

Note:
-The changePizzaSizes and updatePositions was causing the most lagging. 
-Got rid of the position reset feature to increase the speed. 
-Inlined CSS
-Separated out variables from the for loop in changePizzaSizes function and updatePositions
